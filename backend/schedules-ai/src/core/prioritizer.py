General Prioritization Logic Module.

This module could potentially handle higher-level prioritization logic,
perhaps for goals, projects, or features, distinct from the specific
task prioritization handled in `task_prioritizer.py`.

Alternatively, this file might be a remnant or intended for future use.
Currently contains placeholder structures.
