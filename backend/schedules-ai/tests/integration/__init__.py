"""
Integration Tests Package.

This package contains integration tests for the scheduler-core application.
Integration tests typically verify the interactions between multiple components
or modules, such as testing API endpoints that trigger core logic, or testing
the interaction between services and adapters.

These tests might require more setup than unit tests (e.g., a test database,
mocked external services).

# This file makes the 'integration' directory discoverable as a Python package
