logging:
  level: WARNING # Log less verbosely in production

# --- API Server ---
server:
  # Ensure CORS origins are set to the actual production frontend URL(s)
  cors_origins:
    - "https://app.effectiveday.ai" # Example production URL
    # Add other allowed origins

  # Production might use a different model or have stricter retry settings
  # api_key should always be loaded from environment variables

# --- Constraint Solver ---
solver:
  time_limit: 60.0 # Allow more time for potentially complex solves in production

# --- Adapters ---
rag_adapter:
  placeholder: false # Assume RAG is configured in production
  # vector_db_path: "/path/to/production/vector_db" # Production path
  # embedding_model: "production-embedding-model" # Potentially different model

device_adapter:
  default_source: "FITBIT" # Example: Default to a specific provider in prod
  # Production credentials for device APIs should be loaded securely (e.g., env vars)

# --- Services ---
analytics: {} # Production database connection details would go here or be loaded via env
feedback_storage: {} # Production database connection details

# Note: Sensitive keys (API keys, database passwords) should *never* be stored
# directly in YAML files. Use environment variables or a secure secrets management system.
# The application code (e.g., in server.py or specific modules) should be responsible
# for loading these secrets from the environment and merging them with the loaded YAML config.
