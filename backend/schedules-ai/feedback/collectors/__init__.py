This package contains modules responsible for collecting feedback data
from various sources, such as direct user input, device sensors,
application usage patterns, etc.

# This file makes the 'collectors' directory a Python package.
# You can optionally expose classes from modules here for convenience, e.g.:
# from .user_input import UserInputCollector
# from .device_data import DeviceDataCollector
