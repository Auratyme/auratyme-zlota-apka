# Quickstart

To spin up application, depending on your platform run the correct script.

## Linux

in bash/shell execute following commands:

- `chmod u+x ./startup-linux.sh`
- `./startup-linux.sh`

## Windows

in cmd execute following commands:

- `./startup-win.bat`

**Important**: in case of linux you might need to give the script execution permisions
**Important**: this repository contains .env.dev files which contain test data that allows app to work without leaking secrets, but It also supports .env files with secret data that are not commited. If you have .env files make sure that they contain correct data, because they will override .env.dev files in container runtime.

After that, wait for script to complete and then, start using the app.
